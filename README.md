# Markov-chain-model
1- state S_t+1 depends only on S_t
2- time spent in state -> geometric distribution
3- discrete state space & time

MODEL SPECIFICATIONS:
1- state space (S) for all s=S
2- init state probability (P_0 = P[S_0]=0)
3- transition probabilities (P_ij(t)), where i: current state, j: next state
